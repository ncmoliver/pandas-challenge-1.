# E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is aimed at achieving real-world results by using raw data from an E-commerce type of company to exploit my skills using Pandas (python) to organize, format, explore and clean data. In this project, I had the chance to explore assumptions, generate findings, and ultimately provide a summary of the data provided. In this file I will detail the process I went through in order to achieve the results provided.

## Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning Process

During this analysis, data cleaning was used to make the findings clear. the data is an important part in making the result/findings clear.

- Function dollar_to_millions(x)
  - **x** : Requires a DataFrame of int/float values to be passed in.
  - **return**: Scales The Data and Formats Column Names
    - Scale The Data
      - The raw results were in millions, which can be hard to distiguish.
      - By dividing the money columns by one million, provided an easy way to read the numbers.
    - Clear/Formatted Column Names
      - Using the pandas .rename() function this provided an easy way to rename the column names to easily identifiable column names
