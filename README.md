# E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is aimed at achieving real-world results by using raw data from an E-commerce type of company to exploit my skills using Pandas (python) to organize, format, explore and clean data. In this project, I had the chance to explore assumptions, generate findings, and ultimately provide a summary of the data provided. In this file I will detail the process I went through in order to achieve the results provided.

## Data Analysis

Step 1: Data Exploration

- My initial interest in the data was understanding the company from an average perspective.
  - How much the average prouct sold for.
  - How much the average product cost.
  - How much the average product weighed.
  - Most sold subcategory

## Data Cleaning Process

During this analysis, data cleaning was used to simplify the numbers in the DataFrame. Using a lamba function **dollar_to_millions(x)**:
x ‚á¢ the function requires a dataframe to be passed through.
return

    | Part of Function    | Description/Use Case                             |

| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **(x)** | the function requires a dataframe to be passed through.
return
|
| **Returns** | Scaled Data and Formated Columns:

- Each value in dataframe is divided by 1 Million to simplify numbers.
- Column names are renamed to adjust |

* **(Lambda Function)** dollar_to_millions(x)
  - **x ‚á¢** Requires a DataFrame of int/float values to be passed in.
  - **Returns ‚á¢** Scaled Data and Formated Columns
    - Scaled and Format Data - With the use of a lambda function, the data was scaled (each value divided by one million) and formatted (adding $ in front of the value and M representing million after the value).
    - Clear Column Names - Using the pandas .rename() function, provided a uniform way to rename each column name to a more suitable name that matches the updated data.
