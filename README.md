# E-Commerce Data Analysis

## üöÅ Overview

This project is aimed at achieving real-world results by using raw data from an E-commerce type of company to exploit my skills using Pandas (python) to organize, format, explore and clean data. In this project, I had the chance to explore assumptions, generate findings, and ultimately provide a summary of the data provided. In this file I will detail the process I went through in order to achieve the results provided.

## üó∫Ô∏è Instructions

1. Clone repository [Project Repository](https://github.com/ncmoliver/pandas-challenge-1..git)
2. Open Project Folder (panda-challenge-1)
   - Open wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb
   - Select the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è "Run All" and the program will do the work from there üòè

## üîç Data Analysis

#### Data Exploration

- My initial interest in the data was understanding the company from an average perspective.
  - How much the average prouct sold for.
  - How much the average product cost.
  - How much the average product weighed.
  - Most sold subcategory

#### Most Entries

- Identified the _category_ and _sub-category_ with the most order entries.
- Identfied the top 5 clients with the most orders (Client ID and # of orders).

## üß∫ Data Cleaning Process

‚úì Data cleaning was used to simplify the numbers in the DataFrame.  
‚úì Using a lamba function **dollar_to_millions(x)**:

| Parts of the Function | Description/Function                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **(x)**               | the function requires a dataframe to be passed through.                                                                                   |
| **Returns**           | Scaled Data and Formated Columns: Each value in dataframe is divided by 1 Million to simplify numbers. Column names are renamed to adjust |

  **wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook and VS Code accepted)**
- Run File: This is where the data cleaning, calculations, and analysis took place.
- Pandas:
  - Explored DataFrame to understand data better.
  - Formatted and renamed columns.
  - Performed numerous calcualtions
  - Created new dataframes out of existing dataframes
  - Concatenated two dataframes together
  - Used a lamba function to format and simply numeric dataframe
